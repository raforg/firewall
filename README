INSTALL
~~~~~~~
This was written for a Redhat 6.0 Linux 2.2.x system. The Makefile assumes a
Redhat 6.0 /etc layout and everything else requires ipchains which is a
Linux-2.2.x feature.

Install (as root):

    tar xzf fw.tar.gz
    cd fw
    make install

Edit and install the sample policy file to reflect your filtering policy:

    vi firewall.policy
    make policy

Start/test the firewall:

    /etc/rc.d/init.d/firewall start

For more details:

    make help
