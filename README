README

This contains scripts that manage an ipchains (packet filtering) firewall.
Currently, it is only suitable for (my) home use as it only permits the
following services:

  Outgoing DNS requests to specific hosts (local client to external server)
  Outgoing FTP connections to any host (local client to external server)
  Denial of (e.g. non-anonymous) FTP connections to specific hosts (local client to external server)
  Outgoing SSH connections to specific hosts (local client to external server)
  Incoming SSH connections from specific hosts (external client to local server)
  Outgoing POP3 connections to particular hosts (local client to external server)
  Denial of POP3 connections to particular hosts (local client to external server)
  Outgoing HTTP connections (local client to external server)
  Outgoing NTP requests to specific hosts (local client to external server)
  Outgoing SMTP connections to specific hosts (local client to external server)
  Outgoing NNTP connections to specific hosts (local client to external server)
  Incoming AUTH connections from specific hosts or all hosts (external client to local server)
  All packet fragments and all ICMP packets are permitted.

I will be adding rules describing the communications required for many more
services. The services which are to be permitted and the hosts for which
they are to be permitted is specified in the firewall.policy file. When the
library of service rules is more "complete", it will be possible to easily
implement your own security policy with these scripts just by modifying the
policy file. At the moment, this is really just a backup.

INSTALL
~~~~~~~
This was written for a Redhat 6.0 Linux 2.2.x system. The Makefile assumes a
Redhat 6.0 /etc layout and everything else requires ipchains which is a
Linux-2.2.x feature.

Install:

    tar xzf fw.tar.gz
    cd fw
    make install

For more details:

    make help

Edit the policy file to reflect your security policy:

    vi /etc/sysconfig/firewall.policy

Start the firewall:

    /etc/rc.d/init.d/firewall start
