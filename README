firewall - Linux-2.2 ipchains firewall and NAT administration

This contains scripts that manage an ipchains firewall and various forms of
network address and port translation. All you have to do is read the policy
file and edit it to reflect your filtering policy and topology.

The policy file is composed of sections in which you need to specify much
information: this host's trusted and untrusted network interfaces; this
host's role and function within the network topology; and the incoming and
outgoing services to allow and the internal and external hosts that may
take part in them. It has been designed so as to make this as painless and
flexible as possible.

Each section contains detailed explanations and advice on things such as
when to start the firewall and the security implications of various well
known internet services and advice on how to allow them safely. It is
intended to introduce administrators to some subtleties of packet
filtering quickly so that they can make better informed security decisions
and achieve and maintain effective network security (at least the packet
filtering part) in a very short time. Of course, it will not prevent you
from achieving bad network security, but you will have been warned :)

Each section also contains commented out variables that can be uncommented
and possibly edited to supply policy information to fwup. Most of them
show the default values used by fwup. Others are choices. Others still are
just examples. Hopefully it's clear which is which. Each policy variable
is explained when encountered.

Various network topologies are supported:

    Single Host
    Forwarding
    Masquerading          (outgoing M:1 NAPT)
    Port Forwarding       (incoming and outgoing M:1 NAPT)
    Alias Port Forwarding (outgoing M:1 NAPT and incoming M:N NAPT)
    Static NAT            (incoming and outgoing 1:1 NAT)

Up to 10 untrusted network interfaces are supported, each with a distinct
policy. There can be as much or as little policy sharing between untrusted
interfaces as you like.

The policy is specified in the firewall.policy file.

Read it carefully.

INSTALL
~~~~~~~
This should install on most linux systems. Let me know if it doesn't.
See REQUIREMENTS for runtime requirements.

Unpack the distribution:

    tar xzf firewall-20000817.tar.gz
    cd firewall-20000817

Read the policy file and edit it to reflect your filtering policy and topology:

    vi firewall.policy

Install (as root):

    make uninstall # if a previous version is installed
    make install
    make policy

For more details:

    make help

This will cause the firewall to be started at boot time before the
network starts and after each new IP address is received via PPP
or DHCP (if applicable). The firewall will be stopped at shutdown
time after networking is stopped.

After setting up a firewall, don't forget to run port scanners (e.g. nmap) on
your untrusted interfaces (as root from the inside and the outside) to make
sure that you got what you wanted. If there are any surprises, investigate.

EXTRAS
~~~~~~
The examples directory contains several example policy files.

The tools directory contains the following utilities:

    dns2ip - a filter that translates domain names into IP addresses
    fwhelper - helps the testing and development of an ipchains firewall
    portscan - performs a thorough port scan
    tuplegram - prints a histogram of connection tuples in tcpdump output

The patches directory contains two patches that you might find useful:

    ipchains-Q.patch
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    This is a patch for ipchains-1.3.9 which adds the -Q option.
    This option takes a filename or ``-'' as an argument.
    If a filename is given, ipchains reads its commands from the file.
    If ``-'' is given, ipchains reads its commands from standard input.
    Blank lines and shell-style comments are ignored so it is possible
    to write executable #!/sbin/ipchains scripts.

    This allows ipchains to perform all of it's tasks in a single process
    instead of several hundred invocations of the same process so starting
    an ipchains packet filtering firewall can now be done instantaneously.

    masq-demasq.patch
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    This is a patch for linux-2.2.13 which makes port forwarding
    work when initiated from inside the masqueraded network(s).

    Written by Michael Best <michael@com.org>

    Note: I haven't tested this - raf

20000402

    - Shortened/cleaned up fwup a bit with more functions
    - Fixed bug: SSH1 rules were allowing SSH2 as well
    - Fixed doco: outgoing SSH2 note was stupid
    - Fixed bug: SDNS rules were allowing CDNS as well
    - Fixed bug: masqueraded UDP (e.g. CDNS!) failed (func vars weren't local)
    - Fixed bug: SNMP[T] rules from Chapman & Zwicky disagreed with RFC 1157
    - Fixed bug: typo in DHCP Client rules allowed incoming address updates even when $DHCP_SERVERS is empty
    - Added the ability to specify more simple tcp services in the policy file

20000421

    - Added LDAP, NOTES

BUGS
~~~~
- The *SERVERS* and *CLIENTS* policy variables for a given service apply to all
  instances of a service across a given interface. This means that if you have
  something like: SERVICES="oservice.targeta oservice.targetb", then the hosts
  in both targeta and targetb are restricted to connecting to the same set of
  external servers for the given service. Let me know if this is a problem.
  It can be fixed but the policy file will get a bit uglier.

- Masquerading across multiple interfaces is not supported. This is probably
  a feature since doing so seems strange. Let me know if this is a problem.

- When port forwarding, internal hosts shouldn't try to make connections to
  the forwarded port on the external interface because it doesn't work with
  a stock kernel. Michael Best has written a patch to linux-2.2.13 to fix this.
  It's in the patches directory under masq-demasq. Here is his explanation of
  the problem:

- There is no support for static NAT between internal networks. Let me know
  if this is a problem. This needs to be fixed. In the meantime, you can
  execute the necessary ip commands separately using priorities below 10000.

- Stopping the firewall stops packet forwarding in general. This is intentional.
  However, on Redhat systems with FORWARD_IPV4="yes" in /etc/sysconfig/network,
  packet forwarding isn't stopped when the firewall is stopped. This is a
  convenience (but it is unsafe).

- "make install" on systems with rc.local appends a "filewall reload" command
  to the rc.local file. So the firewall will start after the network is up.
  You should change this so the firewall starts before the network is up.
  If this is a problem, tell me where the command needs to go.

- There is no support for using ipchains' REDIRECT target.

TODO
~~~~
More testing
Add services: vpn, cuseeme, vdolive, quake, unreal tournament, ...
Improve fwhelper
Add support for netfilter/iptables when linux-2.4 is ready
