firewall - Linux-2.2 ipchains (packet filtering) firewall administration

This contains scripts that manage an ipchains (packet filtering) firewall.
All you have to do is edit the policy file as per your requirements.

Policies are specified by editing the policy file to specify trusted and
untrusted network interfaces, the services you wish to permit, and the
external hosts which may take part in these services.

This supports up to 10 untrusted interfaces, each with a distinct policy
(Although all aliases on a single untrusted interface are treated equally).
There can be as much or as little sharing of policy between untrusted
interfaces as you like.

There is primitive support for IP masquerading. Masqueraded hosts can engage
in permitted outgoing services (except DHCP, PPTP and IPSEC) exactly like
the current host and are bound by the same restrictions. Distinct policies
for internal hosts isn't implemented because there's no NAT support yet.

The policy is specified in the firewall.policy file.

Read it carefully.

INSTALL
~~~~~~~
This was written for a Redhat 6.0 Linux 2.2 system. The Makefile assumes a
Redhat 6.0 /etc layout (so you might have to edit the Makefile or install
manually). Everything else requires ipchains which is a Linux-2.2 feature.

Install (as root):

    tar xzf firewall-20000309.tar.gz
    cd firewall-20000309
    make install

Edit the sample policy file to reflect your filtering policy and install it:

    vi firewall.policy
    make policy

Start/test the firewall (before untrusted interfaces are brought up):

    /etc/rc.d/init.d/firewall start

For more details:

    make help

Note: Don't trust it. Test it. Many services haven't been tested yet.
Please send any bug reports, criticism, comments, suggestions, patches ...

After setting up a firewall, don't forget to run port scanners (e.g. nmap) on
your untrusted interfaces (as root from the inside and the outside) to make
sure that you got what you wanted. If there are any surprises, investigate.

HISTORY
~~~~~~~
19991231

    - Initial version.

20000309

    - Incorporated linux-firewall-tools.com:
      - Added more protection against spoofing and dangerous services
      - Added more kernel protection (source routing, redirects, syn cookie,
        defrag, icmp broadcast echo, bogus error response, martian logging)
      - Added services (DHCP, HTTPS, HTTP PROXY, IMAP, ICQ, Real Audio)
      - Changed default forward policy from deny to reject
      - Added "untrusted networks"
      - Added configuration of masquerade timeouts
    - Split SSH into SSH1 and SSH2
    - Added BGP and RSYNC
    - Fixed DNS policy variables and doco
    - Cleaned up, fixed bugs
    - Modified fwup to run on non redhat systems
    - Added "make decent"
    - Started logging incoming ping and traceroute even if accepted
    - IP forwarding only started/stopped if masquerading requested
    - Started denying/rejecting fragments (kernel must always defrag)
    - Started using local and masqueraded port ranges (from Mike A. Harris)
    - Added SMB, PPTP and IPSEC (from Yan Seiner)
    - Added support for multiple untrusted interfaces with differing policies
    - Added automatic identification of local networks

BUGS
~~~~
- More chains and rules are created than is absolutely necessary.
  This wastes time during firewall creation but they are not used
  and should have no effect on packet filtering speed.

- There is no NAT support yet.

- Logging isn't configurable.

TODO
~~~~
More testing
Network Address/Port Translation
Services: kerberos (at least kpop)
Policy preprocessor to translate names into addresses
Make logging configurable
Improve fwhelper
