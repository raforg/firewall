This directory contains two patches that you might find useful:

ipchains-Q.patch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a patch for ipchains-1.3.9 which adds the -Q option.
This option takes a filename or ``-'' as an argument.
If a filename is given, ipchains reads its commands from the file.
If ``-'' is given, ipchains reads its commands from standard input.
Blank lines and shell-style comments are ignored so it is possible
to write executable #!/sbin/ipchains scripts.

This allows ipchains to perform all of it's tasks in a single process
instead of several hundred invocations of the same process so starting
an ipchains packet filtering firewall can now be done instantaneously.
