ipchains-1.3.*-Q.patch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a patch for ipchains-1.3.9 or ipchains-1.3.10 which adds the -Q
option. This option takes a filename or ``-'' as an argument. If a filename
is given, ipchains reads its commands from the file. If ``-'' is given,
ipchains reads its commands from standard input. Blank lines and shell-style
comments are ignored so it is possible to write executable #!/sbin/ipchains
scripts.

This allows ipchains to perform all of it's tasks in a single process
instead of several hundred invocations of the same process so starting
an ipchains packet filtering firewall can now be done instantaneously.
